# **Scripts**

List of scripts I've created to make my daily life easier.

## Home

Home is a script that allows me to launch tmux with a specific configuration so I don't have to do it manually every day.

Ghrepos is a script that allows me to pull all or some of my repositories using the GitHub CLI.
